# Derivatives and Neural Networks

## Project description
We are going to study, both theoretically and empirically, the impact of adding discrete derivatives of the historical data as regressors in order to improve the performance of neural network prediction models. In simple terms, if we give a neural network a sequence of real numbers and ask it to predict the next few values, how helpful is it to provide the model with the consecutive difference (and/or second differences) of the elements of the sequence?
